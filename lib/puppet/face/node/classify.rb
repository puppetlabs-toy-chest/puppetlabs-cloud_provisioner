    summary 'Add a node to a dashboard group'
    description <<-EOT
      Make The External Node Classifier aware of a newly created agent
      and classify it. This only supports the Dashboard as a node classifier
      and assigns the node to a group.  The group itself is expected to have
      classes the node should receive in its configuration catalog

      Classification of a node will allow it to receive proper configurations
      on its next run

      This action is not restricted to cloud machine instances.  It can be run
      multiple times for a single node.

      This action may also be carried out before the install action.
